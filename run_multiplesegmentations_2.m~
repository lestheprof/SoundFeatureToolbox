% run_multiplesegmentations_2: LSS March 2019 
% l.s.smith@cs.stir.ac.uk
%
% function to run through segmenting a single file (1st in the list at
% [sd  / filelist] with vaying number of filters 1 to nfilters.
% creates a lot of files with the segmentations produced, and then loads
% them into  a single structure segments which is nfilters by 1 with the
% segmentation for each number of filters. The intent it that the user
% compare what they expect with what's produced, for example for continuous
% sopeech and continuoius speech in noiose. Note that continuous speech
% does not have word boundaries (for example, the word "semiquaver" is pronounced in
% exactly the same way as "semi quaver" would be in continuous speech). What
% this
% system finds is onsets and offsets, and so it is sensitive to starts and
% finishes of eneregy in different parts of the spectrum.
%
% sd is the directory with the sounds (.wav, for example) (so
% 'stimuli_2019' might be appropriate)
% filelist is the file containing the name of the file to be processed
% e.g. 'fournmubers.wav'
% nfilters is the number of filters to be used (e.g. 25)
%
% returns a structure array with nfilters elements, each containing the
% segmentation prxoduced for that  number of channels.
%
% intended simply to show effect of filter number
